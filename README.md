Step 1: Define the Goal, Not the Process
The core principle: Articulate the end state you want to reach, not the steps to get there.

Step 2: Specify Constraints (Not Rules)
The key distinction: Constraints describe what the output is not or what boundaries it operates within. Rules describe procedural steps.

Step 3: Give examples.
Models learn intent more effectively from what you show them than what you tell them.

Step 4: Embed Performance Criteria
Instead of “maximize X” specify “I need X at this specific level because...”

Step 5: Hierarchical Goal Structure (When Goals Are Complex)

Conclusion: here’s a solid template.
Here’s the optimal structure based on my research:
[Primary Goal]: I need [output type] that [accomplishes what]

[Context]: This is for [audience/domain], where [what matters]

[Examples & Performance]: Success means [specific observable outcome], not [what failure looks like].

[Constraints]: Focus on [priority], avoid [anti-priority]

[Outcome]: The reader should [what they’ll be able to do after]
